about the conference booktitles - currently the state is:

Best to unify this like this:

... with manual search and replace... and at the same time, update venue

booktitle = {.*}

booktitle = {Proceedings of the 12th Sound and Music Computing Conference (SMC2015)}
http://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/smc15/files/FinalProceedings.pdf - for editors

* Besides publisher, there is also organization, for 2015 we have: Music Technology Research Group, Dept. of Computer Science, Maynooth University, which is likely organizer, not publisher? But for now, keep it in publisher...

For 2014, there is joint with ICMC - example https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/152725/abuse-of-address-field-in-bibtex-entries? no actually in:
  Publisher, location, and year in @inproceedings and @incollection. https://github.com/moewew/biblatex-trad/issues/21

booktitle = {Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Approximation,
and the 14th International conference on Randomization, and combinatorial
optimization: algorithms and techniques},
series = {APPROX/RANDOM'10},

so, ICMC2016 is 42nd International Computer Music Conference hosted by HKU University of the Arts Utrecht and Gaudeamus Muziekweek. (http://www.icmc2016.com/), so 2014 should be 40th International Computer Music Conference
http://www.sgt.gr/eng/SPG937/ confirms: 40th International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) | 11th Sound and Music Computing Conference (SMC)
So: Proceedings of the 11th Sound and Music Computing Conference, and the 40th International Computer Music Conference (SMC/ICMC2014)
Actually, title page has it: http://speech.di.uoa.gr/ICMC-SMC-2014/images/Files/Preface.pdf - multiple ISBN?

For the names, try use a script to check (if . present in author, then use pdfinfo or something) - papers-check-names.py
Hmmm... looks like for this:
# 02_SMC Conference 2015:044/74: orig 'G. Presti and D.A. Mauro and G. Haus' ->  _DATA_/02_SMC\ Conference\ 2015/smc_2015_044.pdf
... the short names are in the PDF as well... pdfinfo is: Author:         G. Presti1, D.A. Mauro2, and G. Haus1
# 10_SMC Conference 2007:008/65: orig 'C. Le Prado and S. Natkin' -> _DATA_/10_SMC\ Conference\ 2007/smc_2007_008.pdf ; here are long names.. but pdfinfo: Author: IEEE

so we have, as text:

so basically, could do pdf2text, then show only the part to the first @ in the emails, which would reveal the names?

Note, problem with pdftotext and winAnsi encoding:
when I do evince _DATA_/10_SMC\ Conference\ 2007/smc_2007_059.pdf and copypaste text, get:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24107759/strange-behaviour-of-a-pdf-to-text-conversion
 the problem is the same even if I try to copy a bunch of text from the pdf document end paste it in a text document. - this normally is a good indicator that trouble is ahead for other programmatic text extraction attempts. And the encoding used is not always as easy as the one I the question @Jongware points to. – mkl Jun 8 '14 at 16:12
 Not all text in every PDF is extractable; see stackoverflow.com/questions/21279548/… (summary: yes, it is the encoding, but you don't know which one is used unless spcified). – usr2564301 Jun 8 '14 at 15:59
Yup, the fonts are encoded (using "Adobe-Identity-UCS"), and there is no further encoding information stored. See mkl's stackoverflow.com/a/15727984/2564301 for a longer story. (OT: its binary header reads "Derek's PDF". Interesting--haven't seen that one before.)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12703387/pdf-font-encoding-why-cant-i-copy-text-from-a-pdf
pdffonts gives a first quick overview. It returns the following info:
The column uni should contain a yes entry. The no in that column indicates that a /ToUnicode table is missing in the font used by the PDF. That font is embedded as a subset under the name YLWHHJ+FrenchScriptMT. It also uses a Custom font encoding (most likely using a /Differences array). Without a correct and complete /ToUnicode table it will be impossible to extract the text correctly.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9857818/troubles-with-cp1251-printed-file-from-word
I want to extract only text and index this files. Problem is I get garbage output from pdftotext. I tried to export example PDF file from Acrobat, and I again got garbage, but additionally processing with iconv got me right data:
iconv -f windows-1251 -t utf-8 Adobe-exported.txt
But same trick doesn't work with pdftotext
... here cannot get even with Adobe exported...

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17193839/where-can-i-a-mapping-of-identity-h-encoded-characters-to-ascii-or-unicode-chara
Also, Identity-H is just a 1:1 character mapping for all characters from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF. ie. Identity is an identity mapping.
Your real problem is the missing /ToUnicode entry in this PDF. I suspect there is also an embedded CMap in your PDF that explains why there could be 3 bytes per character.

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/354293/normalize-authors-names-in-bib-file
... no answer so far - will have to code my own script...

************

after removing the (two) duplicate entries; and finding the missing PDFs (some are preprint, but some have copyright), now can do a final manual paper title/authors check; use JabRef4 for a live preview of the PDFs...

* probably also have to make a script - papers-after-dupl-rename.py - that will do a "numerical" rename for PDFs (and so also in the .bibs) now that duplicates are removed.. (note, at this time, papers-check-missing-pdf.py does not report any missing PDFs anymore)...
** also, here discovered that I had a 'year' missing in one - do a script that checks for fields consistency... papers-check-missing-pdf.py reports 'volume' and 'origtitleb' missing;
*** added 'volume' manually - now only 'origtitleb' is reported, ignoring that one
** did this - paid attention to everything, except I forgot to change the bibtex keys! made papers-sync-id-nporder.py just to fix this... re-checked consistency after this, looks OK...

 title = {TC-Data: Extending Multi-touch Interfaces for Generalized Relational Control},
 urlpdf = {http://speech.di.uoa.gr/ICMC-SMC-2014/images/VOL_1/0762.pdf},

--- it's like that on the site... probably there was an alternative version if I remember?

also - @inproceedings{smc:2005:013, the pdf has IEEE copyright notice, but "reprinted with permission"

Removing the smc:2015:001/smc:2015:014 duplicate... and run papers-after-dupl-rename.py .. looks OK.

* Then finally, will probably have to remove the 'file' entries for those PDFs that were missing earlier, that have bibliographic info from other conferences... so they are not uploaded...

  communities: support for multiple curators per community · Issue #810 · zenodo/zenodo · GitHub
  https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/810
I would like to give a 👍 on this issue, hopefully it will be addressed in a future milestone.
As well important for us from EFSA.
For us the community is in reality "EFSA owned", not really "personell".
So it would be very usefull, if there could be multiple curators or goups per community.

[Community curation · Issue #35 · zenodo/zenodo · GitHub](https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/35)

    Allow curators to edit metadata.

Damn... ah nevermind, let's try make upload script...

  Developers | Zenodo
  http://developers.zenodo.org/#quickstart-upload

All API access requires an access token, so create one.
https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/
Did one, PersonalAllScopes with:
  deposit:actions
  Allow publishing of uploads.
  deposit:write
  Allow upload (but not publishing).
it is: BH4cyXei3...
note: "Do not share this personal access token. It gives full access to your account."

also check:
http://developers.zenodo.org/#deposit-metadata
http://developers.zenodo.org/#representation

NOTE: once "published", then it is impossible to delete an entry? No button in GUI - and the API says:
https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/849079/actions/discard
{
  "message": "The method is not allowed for the requested URL.",
  "status": 405
}
... actually, discard is just discard changes?

Indeed:

# Publish a deposition. Note, once a deposition is published, you can no longer delete it.
# (Delete an existing deposition file resource. Note, only deposition files for unpublished depositions may be deleted.)
# "Don’t execute this last step - it will put your test upload straight online."

So, this first one I cannot delete anymore:
https://zenodo.org/deposit/849079
Will make sure not to publish others?

(Need to parse months - https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ looks great, but sudo pip3 install fails - https://bitbucket.org/ruamel/yaml/issues/95/pip3-install-ruamelyaml-fails - so manually)

Zenodo for published has: https://zenodo.org/record/849079 => with PDF preview;
for unpublished it has  : https://zenodo.org/deposit/849133 => and this is an edit form, no PDF preview...
